## Reporting Bugs or Suggesting Features

Please file an issue for discussion of new features or bugs. If an existing issue already exists, please comment there instead if you have more details to provide.

If you're logging a bug, please be as detailed as possible. It's highly recommended that you post a minimum `maskfile.md` that reproduces the problem so we can debug it more easily. Issues may be closed if you don't provide enough info.





## Submitting Pull Requests

A final decision always must be made by a maintainer within an issue before work begins on a PR for the chosen solution. After a maintainer has signed-off on a solution, please leave a comment if you're interested in tackling it unless someone before you already has indicated so. Pull requests that don't have a corresponding issue may be closed.

Adding tests is highly recommended, though not always necessary depending on the scope of changes made.

When submitting a pull request, please fill in all of the details within the PR template.
